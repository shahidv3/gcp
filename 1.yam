🧾 Monitoring & Observability: SAMA-Oriented Response

🧭 1. Monitoring Strategy & Coverage

“Our observability approach follows a full-stack strategy across infrastructure, applications, services, APIs, and user experience.
We’re using Dynatrace to achieve automatic and continuous discovery and monitoring, and Grafana for real-time visualization and business-specific dashboards.
Our monitoring includes both OCI (Orchid) and GCP, covering Kubernetes clusters, virtual machines, load balancers, databases, and application runtimes.”

📡 2. Real-time Detection & Alerting

“Dynatrace provides AI-powered detection of anomalies and performance degradations, allowing our teams to detect incidents in real-time.
Alerts are automatically generated based on service-level baselines and are integrated with our ITSM and on-call systems.
For transparency and responsiveness, all critical alerts are sent to our SOC and cybersecurity team within defined SLAs.”

⸻

📁 3. Centralized Logging & Audit Trails

“All system and application logs are ingested centrally.
Logs from GCP (via Cloud Logging) and OCI (via Service Connector Hub) are stored and monitored.
Access logs, admin activities, and privileged session events are logged and correlated with observability data.
We retain logs according to SAMA’s retention policy and ensure they are immutable, auditable, and backed up.”

📉 4. Dashboards, SLOs & SLA Compliance

“Grafana is used to visualize SLOs and SLAs, tailored for both technical and compliance stakeholders.
We have dashboards that show the health of key services, uptime metrics, latency, error rates, and performance KPIs.
These dashboards are regularly reviewed and used to report to auditors, stakeholders, and risk committees.”

⸻

🧠 5. Root Cause Analysis & Incident Management

“Dynatrace’s Davis AI engine automatically performs root cause analysis, drastically reducing mean time to identify (MTTI) and mean time to resolve (MTTR).
This ensures we address the actual source of problems rather than symptoms.
Incident timelines, contributing factors, and impacted components are all captured and documented for audit purposes.”

⸻

🔐 6. Security Observability & Integration

“We integrate observability with ThreatQ and our SIEM platform, enabling real-time correlation between performance events and security anomalies.
For access to production systems, we use Teleport with Just-In-Time (JIT) access, which logs every session and limits exposure.
These logs are available for forensics and compliance review.”

⸻

📜 7. Compliance & Framework Alignment

“Our monitoring and observability approach aligns with the SAMA Cybersecurity Framework, specifically:
	•	3.2.2 (Continuous Monitoring)
	•	4.2.1 (Threat and Anomaly Detection)
	•	6.1 (Logging and Monitoring of Activities)
We maintain all related documentation, procedures, and audit trails to demonstrate readiness and compliance at any point.”

⸻

✅ Summary

“In summary, we have established an observability stack that provides real-time, contextual insights across our multi-cloud platforms, enabling proactive performance management, secure operations, and regulatory alignment.”
